\noindent{\bf Abstract.} Cloud storage, network caches, and local storage are attractive mechanisms for hosting and sharing data in the wide-area, but they are difficult to use together.  This is because coordination is needed to meet data consistency, durability and scalability requirements.  To address this challenge, this paper describes Syndicate, a wide-area read/write storage system that leverages existing services.  Syndicate employs a novel data consistency protocol that lets wide-area users share consistent data through independently-operated caches, regardless of where their data is hosted.  Syndicate decouples data durability and performance while retaining consistency, allowing users to choose whatever underlying caching and storage implementations meet their needs.
